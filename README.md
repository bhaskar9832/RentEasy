# 📌 About The Project

RentEasy is a student-focused accommodation finder platform built to simplify the process of searching for PGs, hostels, and mess facilities near colleges and universities.

Most existing real-estate platforms are designed mainly for apartments and family housing, which creates problems for students looking for affordable and flexible accommodation.

RentEasy solves this problem by providing:

* Student-focused accommodation listings
* Real-time room availability
* Transparent pricing and amenities
* Food and mess information
* Online booking system
* Secure authentication
* Owner property management system

This project is currently under active development as a Final Year B.Tech Project.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Students often struggle to find suitable accommodation because:

* Existing real-estate platforms are not designed for students
* Listings are outdated or incomplete
* Affordable shared rooms are difficult to find
* Student-friendly amenities are not highlighted properly
* Short-term stays are usually unavailable
* Students often depend on brokers and unreliable information

RentEasy aims to solve these issues with a transparent and student-focused platform.
